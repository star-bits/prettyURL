# prettyURL
Click the extension icon to copy human readable URL. Single click copies URL of the current tab. Double click copies URLs of the tabs in current window. The extension automatically decodes the [URL encoding](https://github.com/star-bits/blog/blob/main/utf-8.md) applied to the URL and make it human readable.

## Demo

## Install
1. [Download](https://github.com/star-bits/prettyURL/archive/refs/tags/v1.0.zip) the extension and unzip it.
2. Open the Extension Management page by navigating to `chrome://extensions`.
3. Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch.
4. Click the 'Load unpacked' button and select your extension directory.

## Why is it not on Chrome Web Store?
It seems I need to adapt the extension to comply with Manifest V3 standards before it can be registered on the Chrome Web Store.
