## Install v1.1
[Install](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/prettyurl/lcmeagcdhbdagiecnoknjkbegpghafnh) prettyURL from the Chrome Web Store. The Store now requires all newly published extensions to comply with Manifest V3, necessitating the acquisition of clipboard privacy permissions from each specific website before using copy functionality. This means you'll need to individually authorize clipboard access for each website. To avoid this, you may locally install v1.0, which aligns with Manifest V2 and comes with no clipboard privacy restrictions.

## Install v1.0
1. [Download](https://github.com/star-bits/prettyURL/archive/refs/tags/v1.0.zip) the extension and unzip it.
2. Open the Extension Management page by navigating to `chrome://extensions`.
3. Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch.
4. Click the 'Load unpacked' button and select your extension directory.
